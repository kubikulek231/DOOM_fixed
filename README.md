# SOS-DOOM-SOURCE

This repository contains a slightly modified version of the [original DOOM game](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM).
It is ready to compile with current versions of GCC. Forked initially from [this repo](https://github.com/lunkums/DOOM_fixed). 

This was made as part of our [project repo](https://github.com/kubikulek231/SOS-DOOM-PROJECT) while working on an assignment during the BPC-SOS course at FEEC BUT.
